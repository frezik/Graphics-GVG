=head1 NAME

  Graphics::GVG::AST -- Abstract Syntax Tree for GVG scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GVG scripts are compiled into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Renderers will 
walk the AST and generate the code they need to render the vectors.

Everything is a Moose object.

=head1 Graphics::GVG::AST

This is the root object returned by C<<Graphics::GVG->parse()>>. It has one 
attribute, C<commands>, which returns an arrayref of C<Graphics::GVG::AST::Node>
objects. Each of these nodes correspond to a command or an effect.

Note that variables are filled in statically. They don't appear in the 
generated AST.

=head1 COMMANDS

These all do the role C<Graphics::GVG::AST::Command>, which in turn does the 
C<Graphics::GVG::AST::Node> role.

The attributes on each object correspond to their function description in the 
language. See L<Graphics::GVG> for details.

=head2 Circle

Attributes:

=over 4

=item * cx -- Num

=item * cy -- Num

=item * r -- Num

=item * color -- Int

=back


=head2 Ellipse

Attributes:

=over 4

=item * cx -- Num

=item * cy -- Num

=item * rx -- Num

=item * ry -- Num

=item * color -- Int

=back


=head2 Line

Attributes:

=over 4

=item * x1 -- Num

=item * y1 -- Num

=item * x2 -- Num

=item * y2 -- Num

=item * color -- Int

=back


=head2 Polygon

Attributes:

=over 4

=item * cx -- Num

=item * cy -- Num

=item * r -- Num

=item * rotate -- Num

=item * sides -- Int

=item * color -- Int

=back

There is also a special attribute, C<coords>, which returns an arrayref of 
arrayrefs of coordinates (numbers). These are the list of x/y coords of the 
calculated polygon.


=head2 Rect

Attributes:

=over 4

=item * x -- Num

=item * y -- Num

=item * width -- Num

=item * height -- Num

=item * color -- Int

=back


=head1 EFFECTS

These all do the role C<Graphics::GVG::AST::Effect>, which in turn does the 
C<Graphics::GVG::AST::Node> role.

The C<Graphics::GVG::AST::Effect> role has the C<commands> attribute. 
This returns an arrayref of C<Graphics::GVG::AST::Node> objects, which are 
all the nodes under this effect. Note that effects can be nested:

    glow {
        glow {
            line( #ff33ff00, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.1 );
        }
    }

What this means is left to the renderer.
